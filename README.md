CrossfireConnect
Test C# connection to Crossfire (Firebug extension to allow remote clients to connect to Firebug). 
Need your help. Have BUG. After some time do not send commands to Crossfire. 
Messages from Crossfire are accepted all the time 

I have solved problem by reconnecting to Crossfire if no response in 3 sec.
It is not correct. Bug remain
